# Refactoring & Best Practices In-Class Quiz

Created: Apr 22, 2020 3:11 AM
Status: Not Started
Type: Quiz

We have prepared a Jupyter notebook that depicts a classical task in the day-to-day of a data scientist. One has to scrape data from various websites, transform this data and combine it in order to feed it to a machine learning model.

## Your time for being hands-on has arrived!

Under the folder Day 2 you will find the ipython notebook file `antipatterns_task.ipynb` 

With this file, your task will be the following:

- Fork the repository
- Clone the fork to your local machine
- Under submissions, create a new folder with your name
- Apply what you have learn over the past two weeks. This means:
    - Convert the Jupyter notebook into an actual script
    - This script should be able to be executed in the terminal
    - Relevant parameters of your choice should also be able to be set through the terminal
    - Follow idiomatic Python and the best practices regarding Patterns and Antipatterns
    - Use functions, objects and functional programming where necessary
    - Think where you can include Python modules to abstract logic
    - Remember to follow separation of concerns to divide logic from configuration
    - The objective is not to improve the classifier to obtain a better result.
    - The objective is to re-factor the notebook into a script that fulfills the main objectives of software engineering: Maintainability, Reusability, Correctness, Testability, Reliability, Portability, and Adaptability
    - Think about what can be re-written, removed, improved in order to keep the same general logic of the Jupyter but with an improved codebase
    - You are free to use the command line in an editor such as vim, an IDE such as PyCharm or work directly on the notebook and then export it as a py file
    - The Notebook makes use of standard libraries that are part of the Anaconda distribution. Therefore, you can work locally or in a cloud environment such as Google Colab without problems
- Save the .py file or files in the folder with your name
- Create a bash file that executes the script.
    - In the bash file, one should have the main parameters being passed to the script
    - The bash file should be stored in the folder with your name as well
- Commit your changes to your fork
    - Remember to include a meaningful comment
- Do a pull-request in Git
- You will have **90 minutes** for this task. The submission corresponds to the time stamp of the pull-request
- The quiz lasts 90 minutes and you will have an additional 10 minutes to submit the hash. This quiz closes at 17:10 23/04/2020
- Your solution will be discussed in class
